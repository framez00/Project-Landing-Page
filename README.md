# Project-Landing-Page

This is a project to work on my web development skills which was created by the Odin Project. I might be using content from the internet which is just for training purposes; I don't have any rights to any pictures or texts that will be used. If I decide to use content from the internet, I will make sure to give credit to the person who published it.

The picture of the computer was taken from the website Pexels which allows to download and use the images for free. The creators name is cottonbro studio.
